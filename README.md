# User interface from design on Figma

This application is single page, user interface only, no back-end. It is built as checking out page for e-shop. There were A and B versions, this is a completed UI. Small screens support can be tested by resizing the browser. This user interface was later added to live page requiring old integrations to work with it as it should.
